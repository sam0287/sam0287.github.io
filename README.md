# hello-world
I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in computational statistics at University College London. I am hoping to improve my Github skills so that I can write a website here. Fingers crossed the process isn't too difficult.

## Mathematics
I predominantly work on Monte Carlo methods, which are used in Statistics.  We are concerned with comuting integrals
$$
\int f(x) \mu(dx),
$$
where $\mu$ is some probability measure and $f$ is a test function of interest, on some measurable space $(E,\mathcal{E})$.
