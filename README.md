# hello-world
I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in computational statistics at University College London. I am hoping to improve my Github skills so that I can write a website here. Fingers crossed the process isn't too difficult.

## Mathematics
I predominantly work on Monte Carlo methods.  We use the programming language `R` and commands like `sample` and the package `coda`. Some example code is

```{r}
samples <- rnorm(1000)
mean <- mean(samples)
```

Did it work??
